            <h3> How Does a PID Controller Work? </h3>
            <p>A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller can be used as a means of controlling temperature,
                pressure, flow and other process variables. As its name implies, a PID controller combines proportional
                control with additional integral and derivative adjustments which help the unit automatically compensate
                for changes in the system.</p>
            <h3> PID Controller Basics </h3>
            <p> The purpose of a PID controller is to force feedback to match a setpoint, such as a thermostat that
                forces the heating and cooling unit to turn on or off based on a set temperature. PID controllers are
                best used in systems which have a relatively small mass and those which react quickly to changes in the
                energy added to the process. It is recommended in systems where the load changes often and the
                controller is expected to compensate automatically due to frequent changes in setpoint, the amount of
                energy available, or the mass to be controlled. </p>
            <h3> PID Controller Working Principle </h3>
            <p>
                The working principle behind a PID controller is that the proportional, integral and derivative terms
                must be individually adjusted or "tuned." Based on the difference between these values a correction
                factor is calculated and applied to the input. For example, if an oven is cooler than required, the heat
                will be increased. Here are the three steps:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Proportional tuning</b> involves correcting a target proportional to the difference. Thus, the
                    target value is never achieved because as the difference approaches zero, so too does the applied
                    correction.</li>
                <li><b>Integral tuning</b> attempts to remedy this by effectively cumulating the error result from the
                    "P" action to increase the correction factor. For example, if the oven remained below temperature,
                    “I” would act to increase the head delivered. However, rather than stop heating when the target is
                    reached, "I" attempts to drive the cumulative error to zero, resulting in an overshoot. </li>
                <li><b>Derivative tuning</b> attempts to minimize this overshoot by slowing the correction factor
                    applied as the target is approached.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
